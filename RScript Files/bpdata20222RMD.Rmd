This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. We are using the Notebook to demonstrate some of the capabilities of R and RStudio. R Notebooks are an implementation of what is called 'literate programming'. This allows direct interaction with R code while creating a reproducible document with publication quality output that can be easily distributed to others.

We are performing a transformation of the BMI variable in the bpdata data frame (or dataset). We first load the data from the web -- below is the URL where it is stored on the web in a publicly available web folder.

The code below creates a variable called 'url' and sets the value of the variable to the web url where the csv data file containing the data is located

```{r}
url <- "http://www.duke.edu/~sgrambow/crp241data/bpdata2022.csv"
url
```

Next we create a data frame called 'bpdata2022' and we use the read.csv function in combination with the url variable to pull the data in from the web. If we simply type the name of the data frame, we will see a listing of the variables and data values.

```{r}
bpdata2022 <- read.csv(url)
bpdata2022
```

The first thing we do is take a look at the structure of the dataset using the `str` or structure function. This will provide a compact summary of the dataset including number of observations (n=13),number of variables (n=6), variable names, variable types, and the first data values for each variable.

```{r}
str(bpdata2022)
```

We can see that R has automatically changed the missing values (blanks) to 'NA'.

Now we want to calculate the new variable $ln (bmi)$, the natural log of bmi. We create a new variable in the bpdata2022 data frame called 'ln_BMI' based on the existing BMI variable. The appropriate syntax shown below references the data frame name and new variable name and then uses the assignment symbol '\<-' to indicate that we want to assign the log of the BMI variable to this new variable.

```{r}
bpdata2022$ln_BMI <- log(bpdata2022$BMI)
```

We can now visually inspect the modified data frame by listing the data frame as we did above. As you can see, R has automatically changed the missing values (blanks) to NA.

```{r}
bpdata2022
```
